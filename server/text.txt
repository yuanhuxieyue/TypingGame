I have long realized that the ambition of my life has been
to go on a great military campaign. With dawn, I see that
wish fulfilled. Thousands of us wait quietly in the hull of this
old collier ship, a Trojan horse, ready for Ottomans with our
sharpened British steel. I saw the maps that
the commanders are using, they from the Crimean War,
over 50 years old. How many times will I see the sun rise
over a battlefield? This old dog might getting too tired for war.
After this campaign, itâ€™s time to call it quits.
Some say that our Empire is finished.But we are like fire...
a smoldering hearth requires only fuel to reignite
its mighty flame.Once we had single-shot rifles.
Now they bring us these Nordenfelt guns with their
rapid fire.We have truly joined the modern age.
We load our guns with little messengers of death.
Be warned, invaders,for we do not miss.
